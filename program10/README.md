## Program 10

Using two 8051s, one is programmed to act as transmitter and one as receiver.
The transmitter has two user access buttons, the first button sends the byte related to "1" on the 7-segment display. And the second button sends the byte referring to the activation of "2" in the 7-segment display.
The second 8051 will trigger the 7-segment display with the data received in Port 0.
