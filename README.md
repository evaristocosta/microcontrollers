# Microcontroller exercises

In this repository, several examples have been implemented in both Assembly (`.a51`: ASCII text that is the input for the Ax51 assembler) and C (using library `at89x52.h`), based on the 6th edition of the book "Microcontrolador 8051 Detalhado", by Denys E. C. Nicolosi.

The description of the files will be made shortly.
